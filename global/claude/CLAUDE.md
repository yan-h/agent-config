## Subagent waits

A subagent's prompt cache expires after five idle minutes, while the main session's lasts an hour.
When a subagent idles past that, its next request rewrites its whole context; in one measurement these rewrites were about a fifth of all subagent usage, mostly after five to sixty idle minutes.
Keep long waits — full test runs, CI watching, sleep or poll loops — in the coordinating session: have the subagent implement and run fast checks, then hand back.
Resume a subagent after a long gap only when its context is worth rewriting; otherwise brief a fresh one.
